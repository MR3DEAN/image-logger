FIRST OF ALL THIS FILE IS NOT A VIRUS/TROJAN/RAT/RCE/OR ROOTKIT THAT CAN AUTOMATICALLY AFFECT YOUR PC, WITH THIS TOOL YOU CAN MAKE IMAGE-LOGGERS TO, BASICALLY GET THEIR IP AND OTHER INFORMATION/DATA.

1. Download the .zip (click on code and then click on download zip)

2. Extract the folder wherever you want (desktop if its possible)

3. Make a discord server (you will receive the logs there)

4. Create a webhook on the server (the name of the webhook will be automatically changed to Image Logger when sending a message)

5. Modify main.py (Change base config/webhook/webhook url/ and paste your webhook link)

6. Search for an image and get the url of the image and modify main.py again (Change base config/image/image url/ and paste the image link)

7. Create a new github repositorie for the image-logger (doesnt change anything if you make it public or private)

8. Click on "creating a new file" and do this exactly as it shows (your repositorie name, click slash, api, click slash again, and write .gitkeep and press commit changes)

9. Rename main.py to any name you want (optional)

10. Move main.py and requirements.txt to the repositorie and click commit changes

11. Now go to www.vercel.com and make an account (if you already have one then log in)

12. Then go to the main page on vercel and click Add new.../project and import the image-logger repositorie from github then click deploy

13. Dont worry asking if you did something bad, its completely ok (it will show you 404: NOT_FOUND, Code "Not_Found")

14. Click on the 404 image and then copy the link of the page

15. Modify the link of the image to "YourRepositorieName/api/main.py" (it will be like https://something.vercel.app/api/main.py)

16. Paste the link in any server you want and then the webhook will send you the notifications! and boom! you made an image-logger!
